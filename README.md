# Overview:
This game-bot program is written to play dinosaur game. All the functions to play the game are included.

## Library used:
This project is based on python pyautogui library.<br />
It uses pixels value from screen to control the game. Using the pixels we can define :<br />
-Jump 
- and restart function for dinosaur game.
Also, it jumps only when it finds an obstacle. For that we have used imageGrab() function which uses pixels on a specified rectangular area and if obstacle is found then it commands the jump function.
